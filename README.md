# Gemini Flash Hashtag Generator

This project uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model to automatically generate a specified number of relevant hashtags for a given caption. It is designed for use cases such as content creation, marketing automation, and social media management where hashtag generation is required.

## Features

- Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash model via Google Generative AI API
- Reads API key securely from a `.env` file
- Accepts caption and number of hashtags as command-line arguments
- Logs timestamps for each major step in the process
- Measures and prints the total execution time

## Project Structure

```

hash\_generator/
├── .env                # Contains the Google API key
├── main.py             # Main script to generate hashtags
├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
└── README.md           # Project documentation

````

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hash_generator.git
   cd hash_generator
````

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate           # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Google API key:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the script with a caption and the desired number of hashtags:

```bash
python main.py "<caption>" <number_of_hashtags>
```

Example:

```bash
python main.py "Exploring the ancient ruins of Hampi" 10
```

This will generate 10 relevant hashtags for the given caption and display the results along with execution timestamps and total time taken.
