## Features
- Generates a user-specified number of hashtags using the Gemini 1.5 Flash model.
- Securely reads Google API key from a `.env` file.
- Supports command-line arguments for caption and hashtag count.
- Logs timestamps for each processing step.
- Measures and displays total execution time.

## Project Structure
```
hash_generator/
├── .env                # Stores Google API key
├── main.py             # Main script for hashtag generation
├── requirements.txt    # Lists Python dependencies
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hash_generator.git
   cd hash_generator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the API key**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your Google API key:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage
Run the script from the command line, providing a caption and the desired number of hashtags:
```bash
python main.py "<caption>" <number_of_hashtags>
```

**Example**:
```bash
python main.py "Exploring the ancient ruins of Hampi" 10
```

This generates 10 hashtags for the provided caption, displaying them with timestamps and execution time.

### Notes for You
- Replace `your-username` in the clone command with your actual GitHub username.
- If you don’t have a `LICENSE` file, either create one for the MIT License or remove the license link.
- For Streamlit, Flask, or GitHub Pages integration, I can provide a tailored `README.md` or additional code (e.g., `app.py` for Streamlit). Just let me know!
